      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Urban green spaces, such as parks, community gardens, and tree
  canopies, play a critical role in promoting physical and mental
  well-being. These spaces provide opportunities for exercise,
  relaxation, and social connection, while also mitigating urban heat,
  reducing air pollution, and offering psychological restoration. Access
  to greenspaces has been associated with improved cardiovascular
  health, reduced stress, and lower mortality rates
  (<xref alt="Yeager, Smith, and Bhatnagar 2020" rid="ref-yeager2020" ref-type="bibr">Yeager,
  Smith, and Bhatnagar 2020</xref>). However, the distribution of these
  spaces is often unequal, reflecting systemic disparities that
  disproportionately disadvantage low-income and minority-majority
  neighborhoods
  (<xref alt="Shukla 2020" rid="ref-shukla2020" ref-type="bibr">Shukla
  2020</xref>). This project examines the relationship between
  socioeconomic factors and greenspace availability in urban areas,
  aiming to provide evidence that can inform equitable urban planning
  and policy decisions.</p>

      <title>Literature Review</title>
      <p>Disparities in greenspace access and quality are deeply rooted in
  historical and contemporary inequities shaped by institutional and
  societal structures, policies, and norms in the United States.
  Practices such as segregation, redlining, and foreclosure have
  historically influenced urban planning and continue to shape modern
  landscapes, perpetuating health inequities. These structural
  inequities intersect with social, economic, and environmental
  determinants of health, including housing, income, and the physical
  environment, leading to uneven greenspace distribution and access,
  which disproportionately impacts marginalized communities
  (<xref alt="National Academies of Sciences et al. 2017" rid="ref-national_academies_2017" ref-type="bibr">National
  Academies of Sciences et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
      <p>The distribution of greenspace varies notably across communities
  with different income levels and racial compositions. The below figure
  from Heo and Bell, shows that census block groups with lower
  percentages of low-income individuals and people of color generally
  have higher greenspace availability. Conversely, neighborhoods with
  higher proportions of low-income individuals and people of color tend
  to have less greenspace. Interestingly, while greenspace coverage is
  lower in these disadvantaged areas, accessibility to park entrances
  appears to be relatively higher, suggesting that while parks may be
  closer to these communities, the overall greenspace available is
  limited(<xref alt="Heo and Bell 2023" rid="ref-heo2023" ref-type="bibr">Heo
  and Bell 2023</xref>). This disparity reflects systemic inequities,
  where wealthier and predominantly white communities enjoy more
  extensive greenspaces, while marginalized groups often contend with
  smaller and more fragmented green areas.

      <title>Methodology</title>
      <p>To explore the relationship between greenspace accessibility and
  sociodemographic factors, this project operationalizes abstract
  concepts like income inequality, poverty level, and greenspace
  availability into measurable variables for analysis.</p>
      <p>
        <bold>Independent Variables</bold>
      </p>
      <p><bold><italic>Median Household Income</italic></bold>: Measured as
  the percentage of total households with earnings in inflation-adjusted
  dollars for 2022. This variable is represented by the DP03_0064E
  field.</p>
      <p><bold><italic>Poverty threshold</italic></bold>: Measured as the
  percentage of individuals aged 18 to 64 whose income in the past 12
  months is below the poverty level. This variable is represented by the
  DP03_0134P field.</p>
      <p><bold><italic>Park Accessibility</italic></bold>: Defined as the
  accessibility to the nearest park, calculated using the inverse of the
  minimum distance (in meters) from the population centroid of each
  census tract to the centroid of the nearest park, which reflects
  relative accessibility, with higher values indicating closer proximity
  to parks and greater accessibility.</p>

      <p><bold><italic>Second-Order Property Hypothesis</italic></bold>:
  Census tracts with high poverty rates are spatially clustered, and
  these clusters coincide with areas of low park accessibility.</p>
      <p>The regression table above provides the results where Greenspace
  Percentage is the dependent variable, and the independent variables
  are Median Income, Poverty Rate, and Park Accessibility.</p>
      <p><bold><italic>Poverty Rate</italic></bold>: This indicates a
  positive and statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) association
  between poverty rate and greenspace percentage. For each percentage
  point increase in poverty rate, greenspace percentage increases by
  0.128 units. This counterintuitive result may suggest that areas with
  higher poverty rates have slightly more greenspace or that other
  factors, such as land use policies, are influencing this relationship.
  The statistically significant positive relationship between poverty
  rate and greenspace percentage is notable but may require further
  investigation to understand causality or confounding variables.</p>
      <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="visualization/greenspace_density.png"/>
      <p>The greenspace density plot shows the spatial distribution of
  greenspace density across the study area. The intensity increases from
  blue (low density) to yellow (high density). The regions with the
  highest greenspace density are concentrated in specific tracts. This
  suggests unequal greenspace distribution, potentially aligning with
  socioeconomic disparities in the area.</p>
      <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="visualization/histagram.png"/>
      <p>The histogram shows the distribution of Moran’s I values generated
  from the Monte Carlo simulations. These values represent the expected
  spatial autocorrelation under the null hypothesis of random spatial
  distribution.</p>
      <p>The red line indicates the observed Moran’s I value from your
  actual dataset. In this case, the observed value is far to the right
  of the simulated values, suggesting that the observed spatial
  autocorrelation is much stronger than what would be expected under
  randomness. The observed Moran’s I being outside the range of
  simulated values indicates that the spatial autocorrelation in your
  data is significant.</p>
      <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="index_files/figure-jats/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png"/>
      <p>The choropleth map shows Local Moran’s I values for poverty rates,
  with colors ranging from purple (negative spatial association) to
  yellow (positive spatial association). This supports the second-order
  hypothesis of spatial clustering of poverty rates. The map also
  identifies potential areas for targeted policy intervention.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This project examines the spatial relationship between greenspace
  accessibility, poverty rates, and income in urban areas. The findings
  provide partial support for the hypotheses.</p>
      <p><bold>First-Order Property Hypothesis:</bold> Contrary to
  expectations, the regression results suggest that poverty rates are
  positively and significantly associated with greenspace percentage,
  indicating that areas with higher poverty rates may have slightly more
  greenspace coverage. Median income, however, shows no significant
  relationship with greenspace percentage. These results may reflect
  complex historical or policy-driven factors influencing greenspace
  distribution, requiring further investigation.</p>
      <p><bold>Second-Order Property Hypothesis:</bold> The second-order
  hypothesis is strongly supported. Global Moran’s I indicates
  significant spatial clustering of poverty rates, confirmed by the
  Monte Carlo simulations, which show the observed Moran’s I far exceeds
  the range of simulated values under the null hypothesis of randomness.
  This suggests that poverty is geographically concentrated in specific
  areas, highlighting potential inequality in park accessibility and
  greenspace distribution.</p>

      <p>This report focuses only on Washington, D.C., revealing spatial
  inequities in greenspace distribution and accessibility in relation to
  poverty rates. These findings have important implications for urban
  planning, public health, and environmental justice in D.C. and serve
  as a foundation for broader applications in other urban and rural
  contexts. Here are some directions for further researches:</p>

      <p>Further research is needed to assess whether similar spatial
  patterns of greenspace inequality and poverty clustering are present
  in other urban areas across the United States. Comparing D.C. with
  cities of varying sizes, demographics, and urban planning histories
  can provide a more comprehensive understanding of greenspace

      </p>
      <p>Greenspace accessibility in rural areas, where land use and
  population density differ significantly from urban settings, requires
  distinct policy considerations. Future studies should explore
  greenspace availability in rural areas with high poverty rates to
  understand the unique challenges and opportunities.</p>

      <p>A chrono-health score, which integrates environmental and temporal
  factors affecting health (e.g., access to greenspace over time,
  exposure to pollutants, and changes in healthcare access), could
  provide deeper insights. Linking chrono-health data with spatial
  analysis could help identify long-term health impacts of greenspace

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Urban green spaces, such as parks, community gardens, and tree
  canopies, play a critical role in promoting physical and mental
  well-being. These spaces provide opportunities for exercise,
  relaxation, and social connection, while also mitigating urban heat,
  reducing air pollution, and offering psychological restoration. Access
  to greenspaces has been associated with improved cardiovascular
  health, reduced stress, and lower mortality rates
  (<xref alt="Yeager, Smith, and Bhatnagar 2020" rid="ref-yeager2020-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Yeager,
  Smith, and Bhatnagar 2020</xref>). However, the distribution of these
  spaces is often unequal, reflecting systemic disparities that
  disproportionately disadvantage low-income and minority-majority
  neighborhoods
  (<xref alt="Shukla 2020" rid="ref-shukla2020-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Shukla
  2020</xref>). This project examines the relationship between
  socioeconomic factors and greenspace availability in urban areas,
  aiming to provide evidence that can inform equitable urban planning
  and policy decisions.</p>

        <title>Literature Review</title>
        <p>Disparities in greenspace access and quality are deeply rooted in
  historical and contemporary inequities shaped by institutional and
  societal structures, policies, and norms in the United States.
  Practices such as segregation, redlining, and foreclosure have
  historically influenced urban planning and continue to shape modern
  landscapes, perpetuating health inequities. These structural
  inequities intersect with social, economic, and environmental
  determinants of health, including housing, income, and the physical
  environment, leading to uneven greenspace distribution and access,
  which disproportionately impacts marginalized communities
  (<xref alt="National Academies of Sciences et al. 2017" rid="ref-national_academies_2017-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">National
  Academies of Sciences et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
        <p>The distribution of greenspace varies notably across communities
  with different income levels and racial compositions. The below figure
  from Heo and Bell, shows that census block groups with lower
  percentages of low-income individuals and people of color generally
  have higher greenspace availability. Conversely, neighborhoods with
  higher proportions of low-income individuals and people of color tend
  to have less greenspace. Interestingly, while greenspace coverage is
  lower in these disadvantaged areas, accessibility to park entrances
  appears to be relatively higher, suggesting that while parks may be
  closer to these communities, the overall greenspace available is
  limited(<xref alt="Heo and Bell 2023" rid="ref-heo2023-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Heo
  and Bell 2023</xref>). This disparity reflects systemic inequities,
  where wealthier and predominantly white communities enjoy more
  extensive greenspaces, while marginalized groups often contend with
  smaller and more fragmented green areas.

        <p><bold><italic>Second-Order Property Hypothesis</italic></bold>:
  Census tracts with high poverty rates are spatially clustered, and
  these clusters coincide with areas of low park accessibility.</p>
        <p>The regression table above provides the results where Greenspace
  Percentage is the dependent variable, and the independent variables
  are Median Income, Poverty Rate, and Park Accessibility.</p>
        <p><bold><italic>Poverty Rate</italic></bold>: This indicates a
  positive and statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) association
  between poverty rate and greenspace percentage. For each percentage
  point increase in poverty rate, greenspace percentage increases by
  0.128 units. This counterintuitive result may suggest that areas with
  higher poverty rates have slightly more greenspace or that other
  factors, such as land use policies, are influencing this relationship.
  The statistically significant positive relationship between poverty
  rate and greenspace percentage is notable but may require further
  investigation to understand causality or confounding variables.</p>
        <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="visualization/greenspace_density.png"/>
        <p>The greenspace density plot shows the spatial distribution of
  greenspace density across the study area. The intensity increases from
  blue (low density) to yellow (high density). The regions with the
  highest greenspace density are concentrated in specific tracts. This
  suggests unequal greenspace distribution, potentially aligning with
  socioeconomic disparities in the area.</p>
        <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="visualization/histagram.png"/>
        <p>The histogram shows the distribution of Moran’s I values generated
  from the Monte Carlo simulations. These values represent the expected
  spatial autocorrelation under the null hypothesis of random spatial
  distribution.</p>
        <p>The red line indicates the observed Moran’s I value from your
  actual dataset. In this case, the observed value is far to the right
  of the simulated values, suggesting that the observed spatial
  autocorrelation is much stronger than what would be expected under
  randomness. The observed Moran’s I being outside the range of
  simulated values indicates that the spatial autocorrelation in your
  data is significant.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>This project examines the spatial relationship between greenspace
  accessibility, poverty rates, and income in urban areas. The findings
  provide partial support for the hypotheses.</p>
        <p><bold>First-Order Property Hypothesis:</bold> Contrary to
  expectations, the regression results suggest that poverty rates are
  positively and significantly associated with greenspace percentage,
  indicating that areas with higher poverty rates may have slightly more
  greenspace coverage. Median income, however, shows no significant
  relationship with greenspace percentage. These results may reflect
  complex historical or policy-driven factors influencing greenspace
  distribution, requiring further investigation.</p>
        <p><bold>Second-Order Property Hypothesis:</bold> The second-order
  hypothesis is strongly supported. Global Moran’s I indicates
  significant spatial clustering of poverty rates, confirmed by the
  Monte Carlo simulations, which show the observed Moran’s I far exceeds
  the range of simulated values under the null hypothesis of randomness.
  This suggests that poverty is geographically concentrated in specific
  areas, highlighting potential inequality in park accessibility and
  greenspace distribution.</p>

  factors affecting health (e.g., access to greenspace over time,
  exposure to pollutants, and changes in healthcare access), could

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Urban green spaces, such as parks, community gardens, and tree
  canopies, play a critical role in promoting physical and mental
  well-being. These spaces provide opportunities for exercise,
  relaxation, and social connection, while also mitigating urban heat,
  reducing air pollution, and offering psychological restoration. Access
  to greenspaces has been associated with improved cardiovascular
  health, reduced stress, and lower mortality rates
  (<xref alt="Yeager, Smith, and Bhatnagar 2020" rid="ref-yeager2020-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">Yeager,
  Smith, and Bhatnagar 2020</xref>). However, the distribution of these
  spaces is often unequal, reflecting systemic disparities that
  disproportionately disadvantage low-income and minority-majority
  neighborhoods
  (<xref alt="Shukla 2020" rid="ref-shukla2020-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">Shukla
  2020</xref>). This project examines the relationship between
  socioeconomic factors and greenspace availability in urban areas,
  aiming to provide evidence that can inform equitable urban planning
  and policy decisions.</p>

        <title>Literature Review</title>
        <p>Disparities in greenspace access and quality are deeply rooted in
  historical and contemporary inequities shaped by institutional and
  societal structures, policies, and norms in the United States.
  Practices such as segregation, redlining, and foreclosure have
  historically influenced urban planning and continue to shape modern
  landscapes, perpetuating health inequities. These structural
  inequities intersect with social, economic, and environmental
  determinants of health, including housing, income, and the physical
  environment, leading to uneven greenspace distribution and access,
  which disproportionately impacts marginalized communities
  (<xref alt="National Academies of Sciences et al. 2017" rid="ref-national_academies_2017-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">National
  Academies of Sciences et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
        <p>The distribution of greenspace varies notably across communities
  with different income levels and racial compositions. The below figure
  from Heo and Bell, shows that census block groups with lower
  percentages of low-income individuals and people of color generally
  have higher greenspace availability. Conversely, neighborhoods with
  higher proportions of low-income individuals and people of color tend
  to have less greenspace. Interestingly, while greenspace coverage is
  lower in these disadvantaged areas, accessibility to park entrances
  appears to be relatively higher, suggesting that while parks may be
  closer to these communities, the overall greenspace available is
  limited(<xref alt="Heo and Bell 2023" rid="ref-heo2023-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">Heo
  and Bell 2023</xref>). This disparity reflects systemic inequities,
  where wealthier and predominantly white communities enjoy more
  extensive greenspaces, while marginalized groups often contend with
  smaller and more fragmented green areas.

  accessibility to the nearest park, calculated using the inverse of the
  minimum distance (in meters) from the population centroid of each
  census tract to the centroid of the nearest park, which reflects
  relative accessibility, with higher values indicating closer proximity

        <p><bold><italic>Second-Order Property Hypothesis</italic></bold>:
  Census tracts with high poverty rates are spatially clustered, and
  these clusters coincide with areas of low park accessibility.</p>
        <p>The regression table above provides the results where Greenspace
  Percentage is the dependent variable, and the independent variables
  are Median Income, Poverty Rate, and Park Accessibility.</p>
        <p><bold><italic>Poverty Rate</italic></bold>: This indicates a
  positive and statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) association
  between poverty rate and greenspace percentage. For each percentage
  point increase in poverty rate, greenspace percentage increases by
  0.128 units. This counterintuitive result may suggest that areas with
  higher poverty rates have slightly more greenspace or that other
  factors, such as land use policies, are influencing this relationship.
  The statistically significant positive relationship between poverty
  rate and greenspace percentage is notable but may require further
  investigation to understand causality or confounding variables.</p>
        <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="visualization/greenspace_density.png"/>
        <p>The greenspace density plot shows the spatial distribution of
  greenspace density across the study area. The intensity increases from
  blue (low density) to yellow (high density). The regions with the
  highest greenspace density are concentrated in specific tracts. This
  suggests unequal greenspace distribution, potentially aligning with
  socioeconomic disparities in the area.</p>
        <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="visualization/histagram.png"/>
        <p>The histogram shows the distribution of Moran’s I values generated
  from the Monte Carlo simulations. These values represent the expected
  spatial autocorrelation under the null hypothesis of random spatial
  distribution.</p>
        <p>The red line indicates the observed Moran’s I value from your
  actual dataset. In this case, the observed value is far to the right
  of the simulated values, suggesting that the observed spatial
  autocorrelation is much stronger than what would be expected under
  randomness. The observed Moran’s I being outside the range of
  simulated values indicates that the spatial autocorrelation in your
  data is significant.</p>

        <p>The choropleth map shows Local Moran’s I values for poverty rates,

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>This project examines the spatial relationship between greenspace
  accessibility, poverty rates, and income in urban areas. The findings
  provide partial support for the hypotheses.</p>
        <p><bold>First-Order Property Hypothesis:</bold> Contrary to
  expectations, the regression results suggest that poverty rates are
  positively and significantly associated with greenspace percentage,
  indicating that areas with higher poverty rates may have slightly more
  greenspace coverage. Median income, however, shows no significant
  relationship with greenspace percentage. These results may reflect
  complex historical or policy-driven factors influencing greenspace
  distribution, requiring further investigation.</p>
        <p><bold>Second-Order Property Hypothesis:</bold> The second-order
  hypothesis is strongly supported. Global Moran’s I indicates
  significant spatial clustering of poverty rates, confirmed by the
  Monte Carlo simulations, which show the observed Moran’s I far exceeds
  the range of simulated values under the null hypothesis of randomness.
  This suggests that poverty is geographically concentrated in specific
  areas, highlighting potential inequality in park accessibility and
  greenspace distribution.</p>

        <title>Policy Implication</title>
        <p>This report focuses only on Washington, D.C., revealing spatial
  inequities in greenspace distribution and accessibility in relation to
  poverty rates. These findings have important implications for urban
  planning, public health, and environmental justice in D.C. and serve
  as a foundation for broader applications in other urban and rural
  contexts. Here are some directions for further researches:</p>

            <italic>Expanding to Other Urban Areas</italic>
          </bold>
        </p>
        <p>Further research is needed to assess whether similar spatial
  patterns of greenspace inequality and poverty clustering are present
  in other urban areas across the United States. Comparing D.C. with
  cities of varying sizes, demographics, and urban planning histories
  can provide a more comprehensive understanding of greenspace
  inequities.</p>

            <italic>Exploring Rural Areas</italic>
          </bold>
        </p>
        <p>Greenspace accessibility in rural areas, where land use and
  population density differ significantly from urban settings, requires
  distinct policy considerations. Future studies should explore
  greenspace availability in rural areas with high poverty rates to
  understand the unique challenges and opportunities.</p>

        </p>
        <p>A chrono-health score, which integrates environmental and temporal
  factors affecting health (e.g., access to greenspace over time,
  exposure to pollutants, and changes in healthcare access), could
  provide deeper insights. Linking chrono-health data with spatial
  analysis could help identify long-term health impacts of greenspace
  inequities and guide targeted interventions.</p>

  education, employment, and housing) could provide a holistic view of
